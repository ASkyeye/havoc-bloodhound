## Install

I recommend installing this module through the havoc store only since the module is dependant on beeing located inside of the data/extentions folder inside of havoc:

## Setup

You will need an instance of BloodHound Community Edition more on that [here](https://support.bloodhoundenterprise.io/hc/en-us/articles/17715215791899-Getting-started-with-BloodHound-Community-Edition).
You will then need to download your collector from the web interface inside of the Gear > Download Collectors:

From there inside of the module you can specify it inside of Bloodhound > SharpHound:

Make sure you save your changes for persistance. You will then need to generate API keys inside of bloodhound CE
and supply them to the script through BloodHound > Settings:

Like before make sure you save everything for persistance.
